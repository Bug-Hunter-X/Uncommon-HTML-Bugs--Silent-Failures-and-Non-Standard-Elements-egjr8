This repository demonstrates a couple of uncommon HTML bugs that might not immediately throw errors but lead to unexpected behavior or inconsistencies.  The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The first example shows how attempting to assign a value to a non-existent property of an HTML element doesn't throw an error in JavaScript, while the second example showcases creating HTML elements with inconsistent casing, deviating from standard conventions.
